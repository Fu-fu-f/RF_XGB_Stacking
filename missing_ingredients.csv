They were cooled down to -80C and stored in liquid nitrogen.,Standard cyropreservation procedures do not seem to be efficient for BMMeSCs. Viability assays by flow cytometry was more sensitive. Significant cell death is due to cell shrinkage and decreased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. ,10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.03.04,,,,,,,,,,
